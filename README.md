# BrakeGuard
BrakeGuard is an innovative brake failure indicator that helps drivers stay informed about the condition of their brakes in real time. Here we monitor critical parameters such as wheel temperature and brake fluid level, providing drivers with timely notifications if any abnormalities are detected.
